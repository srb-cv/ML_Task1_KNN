# Bachelor Project Machine Learning

This project serves as a template for every group's git repository. It will be updated during the semester to include new tasks and sample solutions for existing tasks.

**Important:** Please read the information in this README file carefully before starting with the project.

## Getting Started
Please read the documentation on how to [get started](doc/getting_started.md) before you attempt to solve any of the exercises.

## Contact
You can always contact us via the [Mattermost Chat](https://ml-chat.cs.uni-kl.de) if you have any questions, remarks or problems. If your question is related to the content of the exercises or formalities, please consider posting it to the `BSC-Projekt-WS2223` channel so that we can answer it for everyone. In case you have a question that you don't want everyone else to read, you can also DM us.
